## About Myself and My Educational Journey

My name is Øystein Myrland, from Andenes in Nordland. I am a professor (since 2007) of Economics at The School of Business and Economics. My long-term relationship with UiT The Arctic University of Norway dates back to my enrollment as a student in 1986. During my studies, I was introduced to teaching during study groups, where I often ended up lecturing my fellow students---a role I found both stimulating and very engaging. This early experience sparked my passion for teaching, a commitment that has only deepened over the years. Most of this document is written in English because the majority of my current and historical classes, mainly at the master's and PhD level, have been taught in English, largely because they are part of the Erasmus program. Additionally, all my research is conducted and published in English. Only recently have I begun teaching in Norwegian at the bachelor's level, marking an interesting shift in my teaching journey from teaching advanced topics to guiding students through foundational concepts.

I began my formal teaching career during my PhD project in 1996, with a strong emphasis on quantitative courses. Early on, I taught econometrics and market analysis courses using proprietary software like Shazam [@byron1987], SPSS [@hilbe2003; @hilbe2004; @hilbe2005], and Stata [@gutierrez2010] for the traditionally required empirical "data labs" [@kaplan2018]. Recognizing the growing potential of open-source tools, I started using R in 2007[^1] [@r2024] and fully integrated it into my quantitative courses by 2015. This transition was driven by my belief in equipping students with accessible, practical tools that bridge theory and application (see @sec-bed2056).

[^1]: The oldest R script I have found in my backlog of files is dated 22/02/2007. A printout of it hangs on my office wall.

Throughout my teaching journey, I noticed a recurring challenge: students often focused solely on exam-related content, neglecting the practical application of statistical software and coding skills. This gap became evident when supervising master's students who excelled in theoretical exams but lacked hands-on experience during their thesis work. The introduction of the WISEflow digital assessment platform in 2017 provided a practical opportunity to address this gap (see @sec-wiseflow). By incorporating practical coding tasks into exams, I ensured that students developed not only theoretical knowledge but also the applied skills essential for real-world problem-solving.

Over the years, I have supervised more than 50 master's students and 11 PhD students, all of whom have successfully completed their degrees. Currently, I am supervising one PhD candidate, and one candidate has recently submitted his thesis. My formal educational training includes the "Universitetspedagogisk seminar" (UPS) at UiT in 2002 and "Forskningsveiledning" at UiT Result in 2021, both of which have significantly influenced my teaching and supervisory approach. I was enrolled in the 2024/25 class of the ‘Research Group Leader Development Program’ at Helsefak UiT, and the training has been directly relevant to my current role as Head of Research at the Business School—particularly in supporting research strategy, leadership, and collaboration.

## Core Principles of Teaching

As a university professor specializing in quantitative analysis---econometrics, statistics, data science, and finance---my teaching philosophy is guided by a commitment to cultivating statistical thinking[^2] and fostering an analytical mindset in students [@racine2002]. I believe in creating an educational environment where students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their learning journey [@smith1998learning]. This involves teaching as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision-making (see @sec-casebnp).

[^2]: Introduced by @snee1999discussion.

Statistics, as both a methodology and a field of study, is deeply embedded in historical, philosophical, and political contexts. Recognizing this cultural and historical foundation enriches the learning process, allowing students to appreciate how statistical methods evolved to meet the needs of science, governance, and society. This historical perspective also emphasizes the dual nature of statistics: as a descriptive tool for summarizing reality and as a mathematical discipline for making inferences from data. Moreover, teaching statistics critically includes addressing its philosophical underpinnings. Statistics bridges the certainty of mathematics with the uncertainty of empirical observations. It equips students to navigate complex phenomena by identifying patterns and relationships while acknowledging inherent limitations. Highlighting these aspects encourages students to view statistics as a reflective, rather than purely technical, discipline.

Through cooperative and interactive learning approaches, I aim to empower students with the skills to interpret and critically evaluate statistical information. This involves fostering mathematical literacy and numeracy, ensuring that students can engage with statistical representations in the media and everyday life. By embedding these practices in teaching, I seek to cultivate informed students who can actively participate in data-driven decision-making processes (see @sec-newprog and @sec-partner).

## Systematic Development Over Time

A key dimension of my growth as an educator is that each significant pedagogical change has been triggered by an observed learning barrier, followed by a deliberate redesign, and then validated through feedback from students, colleagues, or institutional partners. This section presents my developmental trajectory explicitly, including reflections on what drove the changes and what I learned from them.

### A documented trajectory of development (1996--2026)

| Period | Teaching challenge observed | Change implemented | Evidence / artifacts | What I learned (reflection) |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1996--2006 | Strong "talk and chalk" focus; students learned procedures but struggled with application | Gradual shift to applied examples and guided problem-solving | Course notes; supervision patterns | Students need repeated opportunities to *use* methods, not only reproduce them |
| 2007--2014 | Proprietary software created access barriers and limited reproducibility | Introduced R (2007) and expanded open workflows | Syllabi, lab instructions | Open tools reduce friction and support long-term skill retention |
| 2010--2017 | Students prioritized exam theory; weak practical coding competence | Fully integrated R into quantitative courses; redesigned labs for coding competence | BED-2056 design; lab materials | Constructive alignment must include *assessment* of practical skills |
| 2017--2020 | Need to assess applied competence fairly at scale | Implemented WISEflow practical coding exams; structured feedback routines | WISEflow exam design; grading automation (see @sec-wiseflow, @sec-grade) | Practical exams create stronger alignment and improve learning behaviors |
| 2020--2024 | Program-level need: economists with data-science capability | Co-developed "Economics with Data Science" (BSc 2021; MSc 2024) with colleagues | Program documentation; course portfolio (see @sec-newprog) | Sustainable change requires collegial co-design and shared infrastructure |
| 2022--2026 | New learning environment with LLMs and coding copilots | Integrated responsible use of LLM tools; shifted emphasis to validation and critical coding | Course guidelines; assignments | Students must learn verification and epistemic humility, not only tool usage |

**Reflection:** Across these phases, my development has been systematic in the sense that each pedagogical change was triggered by an observed learning barrier (student behavior, assessment incentives, access issues), followed by a deliberate redesign, and then validated through student feedback, colleague collaboration, and improved alignment between intended learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessment. The timeline also reflects a broadening of scope---from individual course improvements to programme-level redesign and institutional infrastructure (Jupyter)---mirroring an increasing emphasis on collective development.

### Mini-case 1: From misaligned assessment to WISEflow coding exams

**Observed problem:** Before 2017, econometrics exams tested primarily theoretical understanding. Student feedback and my own supervision experience revealed that many students deprioritized the practical coding labs because "it won't be on the exam." This misalignment meant students entered their thesis work with weak applied skills.

**Pedagogical change:** When UiT introduced WISEflow in 2017, I saw an opportunity to redesign assessment. I developed a two-part exam format: a closed theoretical section and an open-book practical coding section where students write and execute R code on real data. This required extensive experimentation with the platform, including testing code submission formats and designing "drag-and-drop" interpretation tasks (see @sec-wiseflow).

**Collegial dimension:** I discussed the new exam design with colleagues teaching parallel courses, shared WISEflow templates, and presented the approach at a departmental meeting. Some colleagues subsequently adopted similar practical exam components in their own courses.

**Result and reflection:** The grade data for SOK-3020 shows a positive trend in the share of B and C grades among business students after 2017 (see the chart in @sec-assessment). More importantly, I observed a qualitative shift: students began engaging with coding exercises earlier in the semester, knowing that practical competence would be assessed. A key lesson was that constructive alignment is not just about what we *teach* but what we *assess*---students allocate effort in response to assessment signals. A dilemma I continue to grapple with is how to balance the complexity of the coding tasks: too simple and the assessment becomes trivial; too complex and it disadvantages students who are strong theoretically but less experienced with programming. I address this through careful calibration of task difficulty and by providing practice exams.

### Mini-case 2: From a single course to a programme redesign

**Observed problem:** The BED-2056 "Introduction to Data Science" course (2018--2021) was initially an elective with 16 students. Its rapid growth to 36 students by 2020 signaled strong unmet demand, but it also revealed a structural limitation: a single course could not adequately prepare economists for data-intensive work. Students reported that the skills learned in BED-2056 felt disconnected from other courses in the programme.

**Pedagogical change:** Together with my colleagues in the economics programme, I was one of the driving forces behind the redesign of the entire economics curriculum. This resulted in the "Economics with Data Science" bachelor programme (launched 2021) and the corresponding master programme (launched 2024). The key design principle was to embed programming and data analysis *throughout* the curriculum rather than isolating them in a single course (see @sec-newprog).

**Collegial dimension:** The programme development required sustained collaboration among economics faculty, dialogue with industry representatives and alumni, and joint decisions about learning outcomes, assessment forms, and technical infrastructure. I had a leading role in designing the course progression, the digital portfolio system, and the standardized Content Management System (CMS) for course presentation. Crucially, this was not a solo effort---the programme represents genuine collegial co-creation, with colleagues contributing course designs, providing feedback, and co-teaching.

**Result and reflection:** The bachelor programme more than doubled applications in its first year and won the BFE faculty "Utdanningsprisen" (Teaching Award) in 2022. The deeper lesson, however, was that individual course innovation is necessary but insufficient: for students to develop coherent competence, the entire learning pathway must be aligned. A challenge I continue to reflect on is how to maintain programme coherence as individual courses evolve and as new colleagues join the teaching team. We address this through regular programme meetings and shared course templates.

### Mini-case 3: From local installation barriers to shared infrastructure (Jupyter)

**Observed problem:** First-year students spent disproportionate time troubleshooting software installations (R, Python, dependencies) rather than learning to code. This technical barrier was particularly discouraging for students without prior programming experience, creating an equity issue.

**Pedagogical change:** I initiated a collaboration with UiT's IT department (particularly Roy Dragseth) to create a shared, browser-based coding environment. This evolved from the initial *rstudio.uit.no* (R only) to the current [*jupyter.uit.no*](https://jupyter.uit.no/hub/spawn) platform supporting R, Python, SageMath, and SQL (see @sec-jupyter).

**Collegial dimension:** This work illustrates collegial educational development: a teaching challenge in my own courses became a shared solution for multiple programmes across UiT through sustained collaboration with the IT department. The platform is now used by students and staff in many disciplines beyond economics, and the IT department continues to develop it---adding Julia and GPU-based PyTorch during 2025. These upgrades have been integrated into our new machine learning courses, giving students hands-on access to Julia and GPU-based PyTorch.

**Result and reflection:** The most significant outcome is that the barrier to entry for coding has been dramatically lowered. Students can begin writing code in their first lecture. However, a limitation I have observed is that the cloud-based environment can create a dependency: some students do not learn to set up local development environments, which they may need in professional settings. We now include a brief module on local installation in advanced courses to address this gap.

### Dilemmas and ongoing challenges

Throughout this process, I have reflected on several dilemmas and challenges. Three stand out. First, the balance between coding and economics: as we integrate more programming, I must ensure that economic theory does not become secondary. I address this by designing coding tasks that are always in service of economic analysis, never programming for its own sake. Second, there is the question of sustainability and scaling: the approaches I have developed (practical exams, automated feedback, digital portfolios) require significant upfront investment in infrastructure and course design. Ensuring that these systems remain maintainable as I share them with colleagues is an ongoing concern. Third, the responsible integration of LLM's: since 2022, tools like chatGPT and GitHub Copilot have transformed the coding learning environment. The pedagogical challenge has shifted from "how do we teach students to code?" to "how do we teach students to critically evaluate code generated by AI?" I am still developing my approach here, and I view this as the most significant teaching challenge of the coming years.

#### A concrete example: the Cheese Case (SOK-3025, Fall 2025)

In a final master-level econometrics course before the thesis semester, I designed a term paper around a real pricing and promotion dataset for a U.S. cheese manufacturer. The case requires students to move from simple OLS estimation through panel data models (fixed effects, random effects, Mundlak) to profit-maximizing pricing and promotion evaluation---a progression that mirrors the complexity they will face in their thesis work.

Crucially, I allowed full use of LLMs throughout the exercise. This was a deliberate pedagogical choice: I wanted students to discover *for themselves* the boundary between tasks where LLMs excel and tasks where they fail without informed human guidance. Traditional, highly structured textbook exercises---"estimate an OLS model on this dataset"---are easily solved by any modern LLM. But the Cheese Case demands that students make sequential modeling decisions, interpret results in economic context, and justify choices that depend on understanding the data structure. Simply pasting my questions into a chatbot did not produce adequate answers.

The student reflections after the exercise confirmed exactly this pattern. Several students reported that LLMs worked well for simple, early tasks---loading data, running basic regressions, producing plots---but became increasingly unreliable as the analysis required more complex panel models and economic interpretation. One student noted: the effort shifted "from coding itself to critical evaluation and validation of the machine's suggestions." Another observed that "when I didn't fully know what I was looking for, it was not a useful tool." A recurring theme was the discovery that prompt quality depends entirely on the student's own conceptual understanding: without knowing which model to request and why, even well-formulated prompts produced elegant but irrelevant output.

Several reflections also revealed a productive discomfort. Students described feeling that the work was "less mine" when heavily AI-assisted, and that the friction of debugging and re-prompting, while frustrating, generated deeper learning than a frictionless process would have. One student captured the core pedagogical insight precisely: "no matter how good AI is, you have to know what you are doing and verify the results afterwards."

This experience has shaped my evolving approach to LLM integration. Rather than restricting AI use or ignoring it, I design tasks where the *analytical judgment*---choosing functional forms, recognizing panel structure, interpreting economic plausibility---cannot be outsourced. The LLM becomes a powerful assistant for implementation, but the student must remain the decision-maker. The Cheese Case demonstrated that this design works: students who engaged deeply with the econometric reasoning produced strong analyses regardless of which LLM they used, while those who relied on cut-and-paste prompting recognized their own knowledge gaps. Both outcomes are pedagogically valuable. I plan to develop more cases following this principle, where the complexity is in the *thinking*, not in the *coding*, and where LLM use is welcomed precisely because it makes visible who understands the underlying economics and who does not.

## Collegiality: Building Teaching Capacity with Others

My approach to teaching is intentionally "open" and collaborative. I share materials, invite critique, co-design teaching solutions, and contribute to infrastructure that lowers barriers for both students and colleagues. In practice, my collegiality is expressed through (i) co-teaching and mentoring, (ii) sharing reusable teaching resources ("open education principles[^3]"), and (iii) collaborative educational development projects.

[^3]: See: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_education>.

### Co-teaching, mentoring, and daily collegial support

Over many years, I have co-taught courses with colleagues at different points in time, including courses in econometrics, market analysis, finance, statistics and data science. In these collaborations, I have taken responsibility for developing shared course materials, assessment rubrics, and coding templates that my co-teachers could adopt and adapt. I actively contribute as a sounding board on teaching design, assessment, and quantitative methods---not only within my own department but also when colleagues from other programmes seek advice on integrating data analysis into their courses[^4]. My mentoring role extends beyond formal supervision. I have mentored junior colleagues in course design and exam development, sharing practical templates and providing feedback on their teaching approaches.

[^4]: Historical note: I created this resource for a colleague nine years ago: <https://rpubs.com/omy000/250560>.

### Open teaching and sharing of reusable resources

I am a strong advocate of what I call "open teaching," analogous to the open-source philosophy in software development. Concretely, this means that I routinely provide colleagues and students with reusable teaching materials, code templates, and reproducible course assets (e.g., Quarto documents, Git workflows, and standardized course pages). All course resources for the Economics with Data Science programmes are published on GitHub and remain accessible even after the course has ended (see, for example, the SOK-1004 course page: [uit-sok-1004-h21.github.io](https://uit-sok-1004-h21.github.io/forelesningsplan.html)). To support collegial reuse, I package course assets---templates, code, assignment scaffolds---in a way that colleagues can adopt directly, and I actively invite peer feedback to improve them over time. This reduces duplication of effort, enables quality improvement through peer reuse, and supports a culture of transparency and continuous refinement.

### Collegial educational development at UiT

The co-development of the "Economics with Data Science" programmes required sustained collegial collaboration across the economics programme, with shared design work on learning outcomes, assessment forms, and technical infrastructure. I had one of the leading roles in this process, during programme meetings, drafting learning outcome descriptions, and designing the course progression. This was fundamentally a team effort: colleagues contributed their own expertise, challenged proposals, and co-created the final programme structure.

Similarly, the establishment of UiT-wide coding infrastructure (Jupyter) was achieved through close collaboration with the IT department, turning a local teaching need into a shared institutional resource. I also initiated and contributed to internal workshops on practical coding assessment and the use of WISEflow, sharing my experience so that colleagues could benefit from what I had learned through trial and error.

### Dissemination beyond the local context

I have published a co-authored article on digital learning [@bertheussen2016] and have shared my teaching experiences through internal presentations and workshops at UiT. I recognize that there is a potential for more formal dissemination---through conferences on higher education and additional scholarly publications on teaching and learning. This is an area I plan to develop further (see the "Plans Ahead" section).

## Core Principles of Teaching (continued)

### Constructive Alignment in Teaching

Constructive alignment, as developed by @biggs1996 and elaborated in @biggs_tang2011, provides the theoretical foundation for integrating learning theory with instructional design. This framework, building on constructivist learning principles [@cohen1987], establishes that effective learning occurs when teaching methods, learning activities, and assessment practices work in harmony to support intended learning outcomes.

The SOLO (Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes) taxonomy, a key component of constructive alignment theory [@biggs_tang2011], has guided my course design, particularly in the progression of learning activities. For example, in my econometrics courses, students advance from understanding basic statistical concepts (unistructural) to analyzing complex economic relationships (relational), and finally to creating original analyses using multiple data sources. This progression aligns with @wang2013 findings on the effectiveness of structured learning progressions in higher education.

At its core, constructive alignment transforms traditional teacher-centered instruction into a learner-centered model. In my WISEflow assessments (see @sec-wiseflow), students demonstrate their understanding not through mere reproduction of knowledge, but through practical application of economic theories to real-world data analysis problems. This approach exemplifies what @biggs_tang2011 describe as "performances of understanding"---assessments that require students to actively demonstrate their grasp of concepts through meaningful application (also see @gardner1993; @wiske1998).

The implementation of constructive alignment in my teaching is particularly evident in my integration of coding tasks and hands-on data analysis (see @sec-casebnp). These activities are deliberately structured to align with both the theoretical foundations of economics and the practical skills demanded by the profession. Students progress through carefully sequenced learning activities that build upon each other, from basic coding exercises to complex economic analyses, ensuring that assessment tasks authentically reflect the learning objectives.

### Fostering Conceptual Understanding

My teaching approach prioritizes conceptual understanding over rote memorization. I focus on enabling students to understand the underlying principles of econometric and statistical methods, ensuring they grasp the "why" behind the techniques they use (see @sec-bed2056).

Conceptual understanding in statistics involves equipping students with the ability to make decisions about data visualization, exploration, and analysis. Students must develop a strong grasp of core concepts like variability, bias, randomness, distribution, and inference. To foster this understanding, I emphasize an investigative approach to learning. Students are encouraged to think critically about how data is collected, explore the questions it seeks to answer, and examine its implications (see @sec-wiseflow).

In line with @dysthe2001 emphasis on dialogic learning, my teaching philosophy recognizes the centrality of dialogue and interaction in fostering deep learning. Dysthe's framework highlights how learning is co-constructed through meaningful exchanges among students, teachers, and the wider learning environment. By creating opportunities for collaborative problem-solving and peer discussions, I aim to transform the classroom into a dialogic space where diverse perspectives contribute to understanding [@brooman2015].

This approach aligns with my use of collaborative assignments, hands-on coding projects (see @sec-casebnp), and my emphasis on student engagement through mid-term feedback (see @sec-partner). I also supervise students on their term papers and strive to provide as much individual feedback as possible on assignments, ensuring personalized guidance in their learning journey (see @sec-supervision for a fuller discussion of my supervision practice).

### Integrating Real Data and Context

One of my primary goals is to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, following @brown1989 situated learning framework, which emphasizes that knowledge is inseparable from its context of use. By integrating real-world data into coursework, students learn to appreciate the relevance of statistical tools in solving complex problems [@libman2010; @herrington2005]. This approach creates what @brown1989 describe as an "authentic activity" for learning (see @sec-newprog and @sec-casebnp).

In my teaching, I incorporate authentic datasets from official sources such as Statistics Norway (SSB), exemplifying Herrington's principles of authentic learning environments [@herrington2005]. Students are introduced to tools like APIs to extract data directly from online repositories, engaging in what @brown1989 term "legitimate peripheral participation" in real economic analysis (also see @lave1991). This hands-on approach enables students to work with real data and enhances their technical skills in data extraction, cleaning, and visualization (see @sec-casebnp).

A critical principle I emphasize is the use of reproducible code in data analysis [@ram2013]. By employing tools that allow for the automatic updating of data, charts, and analysis each time the code is rerun, students learn to create dynamic and adaptable workflows. This approach mirrors real-world practices and highlights the limitations of static "point-and-click" software. Reproducible workflows ensure consistency and transparency and enable students to adapt their analyses as new data becomes available (see @sec-casebnp).

### Emphasizing Multivariable Thinking

Economics is deeply interconnected with societal structures and behaviors [@puhringer2019]. When teaching multivariable thinking, I emphasize examining the big picture to understand how different components of society interact with the economy. Students analyze datasets that involve multiple economic indicators---GDP, inflation rates, unemployment levels---to uncover interdependencies. Through this process, they learn to construct and interpret models that reflect real-world economic complexities (see @sec-bed2056).

To further enhance multivariable thinking, I encourage students to engage in scenario analyses. For example, they may investigate how changes in taxation policies impact both consumer behavior and market prices. Such exercises help students recognize the dynamic nature of economic systems and the need for holistic perspectives when addressing policy questions (see @sec-newprog).

### Active Learning and Collaboration

Active learning lies at the heart of my teaching philosophy, sparked by my own research with a colleague [@bertheussen2016]. This approach resonates with [@laurillard2012] Conversational Framework, which emphasizes the importance of dialogue and iterative interaction in the learning process. The only way for students to truly master the practical and applied aspects of econometrics, statistics, and data science is through consistent, structured practice within their zone of proximal development [@vygotsky1978].

Initially, my teaching approach was rooted in traditional "talk and chalk" methods. However, I observed that while these methods helped students understand theoretical concepts, many struggled to translate their understanding into practical skills. To address this gap, I adopted a more interactive approach, incorporating hands-on activities and collaborative assignments [@becker1998; @henderson2019]. Each assignment is designed to mirror real-world scenarios, requiring students to apply theoretical concepts to data-driven problems. Following the principles of situated learning [@laurillard2012], students analyze datasets to identify trends, create predictive models, or evaluate policy impacts (see @sec-newprog).

Collaboration, grounded in social constructivist learning theory, is another critical component [@henderson2019]. Group assignments encourage students to share diverse perspectives, hone their communication skills, and learn from one another through peer scaffolding. By working together, students not only deepen their understanding but also build essential interpersonal skills that will serve them throughout their careers (see @sec-newprog).

### Leveraging Technology

Technology has been a cornerstone of my teaching philosophy, guided by the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework [@koehler2009]. Through my advocacy for open-source software like R and Python, students gain access to powerful, cost-free platforms that eliminate the barriers of expensive licenses (see @sec-jupyter). Following @hoyt2012 recommendations for economics education, these open-source tools ensure students can continue using these technologies beyond their academic journey.

In 2017, I began using WISEflow, a SaaS solution for exams (see @sec-wiseflow). Aligned with TPACK principles [@koehler2009], this platform revolutionized how I assess students by enabling practical and applied testing in econometrics [@chance2002]. Before adopting WISEflow, exams primarily focused on theoretical understanding, which often led students to downplay the practical components of the course.

Since the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) in November 2022, I have integrated chatbots and tools such as [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) into my teaching practices. The main learning challenge has shifted towards teaching students how to critically evaluate and validate the suggestions provided by these tools. I emphasize the importance of reviewing and verifying the chatbot's outputs to ensure accuracy, fostering critical thinking and coding literacy that prepares students to use these tools responsibly.

### Ethical Considerations

In an era of data-driven decision-making, the ethical implications of data usage cannot be overstated. I emphasize the critical importance of ethical considerations in all aspects of statistical practice: recognizing biases in data collection, ensuring transparency in analysis, and adhering to principles of fairness and accountability when interpreting results. Students learn to critically evaluate the quality and source of their data and explore frameworks for ensuring that personal or sensitive information is safeguarded during analysis. As @scheaffer1998 emphasized, statistical education must include the awareness of the societal impact of statistical methods. I also incorporate discussions on the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making, especially in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### Assessment as a Tool for Learning {#sec-assessment}

Assessments in my courses follow @black1998 formative assessment framework, designed not only to evaluate student performance but also to enhance learning through continuous feedback loops [@hubbard1997assessment]. By integrating coding as an essential component, I bridge theoretical mathematics with algorithmic thinking, creating what @black1998 term "moment of learning" where assessment directly informs instruction. Students demonstrate their understanding of econometric and statistical concepts while implementing these concepts programmatically using Python and R (see @sec-wiseflow).

Additionally, version control tools such as [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and platforms like [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) are integral to my courses [@beckman2021]. Students learn to manage their code repositories, collaborate on projects, and integrate their work with our Learning Management System (LMS), Canvas, creating what @black1998 describe as a "formative assessment practice."

The figure below demonstrates the effectiveness of this assessment approach, showing the aggregate percentile for grades C and B in SOK-3020 Econometrics for business students. The positive trend after 2017 aligns with @ihantola2015's findings on the benefits of integrated programming assessment.

By integrating coding, algorithmic thinking, and modern technological tools into assessments, I ensure that students gain a comprehensive, practical, and forward-looking education [@combs2008]. I also use these tools to automatically generate individual feedback on student performance (see @sec-grade), implementing what @black1998 describe as "assessment for learning" rather than merely assessment of learning.

## Plans Ahead

Looking forward, the master programme in Economics with Data Science is incorporating cutting-edge machine learning techniques that extend beyond the traditional methodological toolbox typically available to economists [@varian2014]. My own research now includes using text as data [@gentzkow2019], leveraging advancements such as Large Language Models (LLMs). By integrating LLMs into the curriculum, we provide students with the opportunity to work with text data in ways that were previously unattainable.

We are also exploring how LLMs can support students in solving coding tasks and how they can be used to programmatically provide feedback on student assignments. We have initiated work on automated feedback systems that leverage LLMs to provide detailed, contextual responses to student assignments, while maintaining rigorous academic standards and promoting genuine learning.

Beyond the Economics with Data Science programmes, coding skills are now being integrated into other programmes at the Business School. I am committed to contributing to this development, ensuring that all students have access to the tools and training necessary for data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, many researchers and students at the Business School currently focus on traditional qualitative analysis. Building on this shift, a colleague and I have provided targeted training and shared resources that help colleagues, Phd's and master’s students adopt computational text analysis methods.

I also plan to co-author a scholarly article on the design and learning outcomes of the Economics with Data Science econometrics course, contributing to the growing literature on data science in economics education.

# @sec-bed2056: Teaching Philosophy in Action -- "BED-2056 Introduction to Data Science" {#sec-bed2056}

The BED-2056 course, which ran from 2018 to 2021, exemplified my teaching philosophy by introducing economics students to the interdisciplinary field of data science [@hicks2018]. Designed to foster skills at the intersection of statistics, data visualization, programming, and applied problem-solving, the course served as an inspiration for the "Samfunnsøkonomi med datavitenskap -- bachelor" programme.

A core feature of BED-2056 was its integration of theoretical knowledge with practical application [@hardin2015]. Students used tools like R and RStudio to clean, visualize, and analyze data, tackling real-world tasks such as working with APIs, web scraping, and time-series analysis. Activities like creating reproducible R Markdown documents and using Git-based workflows emphasized investigative learning and practical competence.

Collaboration and critical thinking were central to the course. Students worked on group data science projects, mirroring real-world environments where teamwork and problem-solving are essential. By incorporating open-source tools, BED-2056 eliminated financial barriers while equipping students with practical, sustainable skills. The course also leveraged platforms like [datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) for interactive coding exercises, providing instant feedback to reinforce programming skills.

The BED-2056 course attracted a modest enrollment of 16 students in 2018. Its innovative approach resonated strongly, and by 2020, enrollment had more than doubled to 36 students. This growth highlighted the increasing demand for a curriculum that integrates programming, data analysis, and applied problem-solving with traditional economics education. The success of BED-2056 sparked conversations among faculty and stakeholders, ultimately leading to the launch of the "Economics with Data Science" bachelor's programme in 2021 (see @sec-newprog).

# @sec-newprog: Economics with Data Science -- A New Educational Approach {#sec-newprog}

The Bachelor and Master programmes in Economics with Data Science at the Business School, UiT, represent a significant evolution in economics education. Initiated in 2021 for the bachelor level and expanded to the master level in 2024, these programmes integrate advanced economic analysis with data science [@engel2017].

The development process involved collaboration with diverse stakeholders, including industry representatives, research institutions, alumni, current students, and professionals. Stakeholder feedback emphasized the importance of practical skills, interdisciplinary knowledge, and the ability to communicate findings effectively. A distinctive feature is the integration of programming and data analysis into every course. Recognizing that many economics students find programming challenging, the curriculum embeds coding as a continuous element rather than isolating it to specific courses.

The bachelor's programme provides a strong foundation in both economics and data science. As students progress, advanced courses combine economic theory with practical analysis, encouraging them to apply their knowledge to contemporary societal challenges [@sekwena2023]. Building on this foundation, the master's programme offers advanced training with themed semesters covering static linear models, time series and dynamic economic models, and causal analysis. The programme concludes with a research-based master thesis in the format of a scholarly article.

A key innovation is the development of a digital portfolio that serves as an "academic CV." Students showcase their analyses, coding projects, and findings, shifting emphasis from traditional grades to demonstrable competence. The programmes also utilize a custom-developed Content Management System (CMS) that standardizes course presentation (see @sec-casebnp and the github [link](https://uit-sok-1004-h21.github.io/forelesningsplan.html)).

The success is evident in the significant growth in student enrollment, which more than doubled applicants when the bachelor programme was initiated, and the 2022 "Utdanningsprisen" (educational award). Early indicators suggest that graduates are well-prepared for careers in both private and public sectors.

# @sec-casebnp: Introduction to Reproducible Research with "Bruttonasjonalprodukt -- BNP" {#sec-casebnp}

In the first semester of the new bachelor's programme, students are introduced to key concepts of economic analysis and data visualization through a practical case study on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. This example, implemented in *SOK-1004 Economic Topics and Programming* in 2021, integrates economic theory, mathematics, and reproducible research practices using R and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). The course plan and student resources are available on GitHub [here](https://uit-sok-1004-h21.github.io/forelesningsplan.html).

Using GDP data from Statistics Norway (SSB), students explore GDP trends and learn how to source, analyze, and visualize real-world data. A key component is introducing reproducible code, where all analysis and visualizations can be automatically updated when data changes. The rendered web page is available [here](https://uit-sok-1004-h21.github.io/case_1_bnp.html).

Reproducibility is seamlessly embedded: all analyses are performed using R and Quarto, ensuring dynamic analysis, transparency, and real-world relevance. Students use Quarto to create both source markdown documents (`.qmd`) and rendered HTML output.

![Markdown Code Example](markdown_code_example.png)

![Rendered HTML Page](rendered_html_output.png)

By the end of the exercise, students understand GDP as an economic indicator, apply mathematical concepts to analyze growth, master basic R coding for data visualization, and appreciate the importance of reproducibility in research and analysis.

# @sec-jupyter: Online Coding Platform -- "Jupyter at UiT" {#sec-jupyter}

Introducing first-year students to coding can be a significant challenge, particularly when they must navigate installing open-source software with numerous dependencies. Recognizing this barrier, I took the initiative to collaborate with UiT's IT department to create a common coding service accessible to all students and staff. This effort was spearheaded with the invaluable support of Roy Dragseth.

The journey began with *rstudio.uit.no*, a web-based platform exclusively for R. Roy subsequently developed [jupyter.uit.no](https://jupyter.uit.no/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F), an expanded platform encompassing [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), and [xeus-sql](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-sql).

Jupyter is an interactive computing environment that supports multiple programming languages through a single interface [@granger2021]. Students can log in using their UiT Feide credentials and access a virtual workspace from any web browser. The platform eliminates the need for local installations, ensuring users can start coding immediately.

![Jupyter Launch Window](jupyter.png)

![Hello World! R Code Example](jupyter2.png)

This platform not only lowers the barrier to entry for coding but also fosters a collaborative learning environment. The IT department continues to develop the platform: during 2025, the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/) and GPU-based [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for machine learning was added.

# @sec-wiseflow: Online WISEflow Exam {#sec-wiseflow}

The introduction of WISEflow at UiT in 2017 opened new possibilities for assessing students. I adapted my courses to incorporate practical coding tasks as part of the exam process, ensuring that students gain recognition for their coding skills.

In *SOK-3020 Econometrics*, the exam structure consists of two parts: a closed session with traditional theoretical questions and an open-book session where students have access to coding tools and online resources. During the open session, students work on practical coding exercises, applying econometric and statistical techniques to real-world data. This format ensures that their ability to translate theoretical concepts into actionable analysis is thoroughly assessed.

![R Code Submission in WISEflow](wiseflow1.png)

![Drag-and-Drop Interpretation Interface in WISEflow](wiseflow2.png)

This approach bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Students not only master statistical methods but also develop the critical skill of effectively communicating their findings.

# @sec-grade: Automated Grade Explanation for All {#sec-grade}

Following the WISEflow implementation, I leveraged the platform's capabilities to streamline grading and provide comprehensive feedback. WISEflow allows for automated point allocation, which I augment with my own comments on coding tasks. After the exam, I download a `.csv` file containing all responses and scores, which I process programmatically to generate individual reports.

Using Markdown in Quarto, I create a reproducible workflow that integrates my comments with performance data. Each report is rendered as a PDF "karakterbegrunnelse" (grade explanation) tailored to the student's performance [@edwards2007]. The reports are uploaded into each student's exam on WISEflow, ensuring transparency and consistency.

![Downloaded .csv File from WISEflow](grade1.png)

![Markdown Code for Feedback Reports in RStudio](grade2.png)

![Final PDF Report for a Candidate](grade3.png)

This workflow mirrors the principles of reproducible research that I emphasize in teaching (see @sec-casebnp). By automating the grading process, every student receives clear, detailed feedback while maintaining high standards of fairness and efficiency.

# @sec-partner: Partnering with Students for Continuous Improvement {#sec-partner}

A key aspect of my teaching philosophy is fostering a collaborative learning environment where students actively contribute to course improvement. For many years, I have conducted mid-term evaluations in my classes, using student feedback to identify areas for enhancement [@mccuddy2008]. This practice has been further strengthened with the new bachelor's programme, where we hold regular meetings with student representatives [@brooman2015]. These discussions address both curriculum content and practical concerns such as assignment timing and exam schedules.

One significant outcome of this feedback process is the development of detailed class notes and handouts that clarify challenging aspects of the curriculum. For example, in *SOK-3008 Models for Market Analysis*, I created a handout on panel data analysis to guide students through this complex topic. During lectures, I use an iPad as a digital blackboard, and all class notes are uploaded to Canvas after each lecture.

![Handout on Panel Data Analysis](panel.png)

I would like to finish this section with a snippet from an e-mail I received in January 2025 from a student in the Econometrics class.

![Snippet of e-mail from Econometrics student](stud_email.png)

I have to admit that this type of feedback is rare, but highly appreciated!

# @sec-supervision: Supervision Philosophy and Practice {#sec-supervision}

Having supervised more than 50 master's students and 11 PhD students to completion, supervision is a significant part of my teaching practice. My supervision philosophy has evolved considerably over my career, also shaped by the "Forskningsveiledning" course at Result in 2021, by my own experiences as a PhD student, and by ongoing reflection on what makes the supervisory relationship productive.

### Master's thesis supervision

My approach to master's supervision is structured around three principles: early methodological engagement, regular feedback cycles, and progressive autonomy. In the first meetings, I work with students to identify a research question that connects to real data and that is feasible within the thesis timeframe. I emphasize the importance of starting with data exploration and preliminary analysis early, rather than spending months on literature review alone. This reflects my broader teaching philosophy of integrating theory and application from the outset.

Earlier in my career a recurring challenge in supervision was that students often arrived with strong theoretical exam results but limited experience applying methods independently. This observation was, in fact, one of the key drivers behind the curriculum redesign described in @sec-newprog: by embedding coding and applied analysis throughout the programme, students now arrive at the thesis stage better prepared. Nevertheless, I continue to provide scaffolding through structured check-ins, shared code templates, and formative feedback on draft sections.

I have also learned, through experience, to be more explicit about expectations and timelines. Early in my supervision career, I assumed that students would manage their own time effectively. I have since adopted a more structured approach, with clear milestones and regular meetings, which has led to more timely completions, good grades and less student anxiety.

### PhD supervision

At the PhD level, supervision is a longer and more complex relationship. My approach here is guided by two insights. First, the PhD student must gradually transition from being a guided learner to becoming an independent researcher. I support this transition by progressively increasing the student's responsibility for research design, writing, and decision-making. Second, the supervisory relationship benefits from honesty and openness---I share my own uncertainties and reasoning processes, not just polished conclusions. This models the kind of epistemic humility that I believe is essential in research.

All 11 of my completed PhD students have successfully defended their theses, and several have gone on to academic careers. I view this as evidence that my supervision approach, while always evolving, provides a supportive foundation for the development of independent researchers.
