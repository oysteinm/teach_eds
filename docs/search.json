My long-term relationship with UiT The Arctic University of Norway dates back to my enrollment as a student back in 1986. During my studies, I was introduced to teaching during study groups, where I often ended up lecturing my fellow students during sessions—a role I found both stimulating and very engaging. This early experience sparked my passion for teaching, a commitment that has only deepened over the years. As you will notice, most of this document is written in English. The reason for this is that the majority of my current and historical classes, mainly at the master’s and PhD level, have been taught in English, largely because they are part of the Erasmus program—a European Union initiative to support education, training, and international exchange. Additionally, all my research is conducted and published in English. Only recently have I begun teaching in Norwegian at the bachelor’s level, marking an interesting shift in my teaching journey, transitioning from teaching advanced topics to guiding students through foundational concepts.\nI began my formal teaching career during my PhD project in 1996, with a strong emphasis on quantitative courses. Early in my career, I taught econometrics and market analysis courses using proprietary software like Shazam (Byron 1987), SPSS (Hilbe 2003, 2004, 2005), and Stata (Gutierrez 2010) for the traditionally required empirical “data labs” (Kaplan 2018). Recognizing the growing potential of open-source tools, I started using R in 2007 (R Core Team 2024) and fully integrated it into my quantitative courses by 2015. This transition was driven by my belief in equipping students with accessible, practical tools that bridge theory and application (see Section 1).\nThroughout my teaching journey, I noticed a recurring challenge: students often focused solely on exam-related content, neglecting the practical application of statistical software and coding skills. This gap became evident when supervising master’s students who excelled in theoretical exams but lacked hands-on experience during the practical work on their master thesis (see Section 5). The introduction of the WISEflow digital assessment platform in 2017 provided an opportunity to address this. By incorporating practical coding tasks into exams, I ensured that students developed not only theoretical knowledge but also the applied skills essential for real-world problem-solving.\nThis evolution in my teaching approach reflects my dedication to fostering a learning environment that combines rigorous academic theory with practical applications.

    "section": "Core Principles of Teaching",
    "text": "Core Principles of Teaching\nAs a university professor specializing in quantitative analysis like econometrics, statistics, data science, and finance, my teaching philosophy is guided by a commitment to cultivating statistical thinking1 and fostering an analytical mindset in students (Racine and Hyndman 2002). I believe in creating an educational environment where students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their learning journey (Smith 1998). This involves teaching as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision-making (see Section 3).\nStatistics, as both a methodology and a field of study, is deeply embedded in historical, philosophical, and political contexts. Traditionally linked to the administration and governance of the state, statistics initially encompassed broad descriptive narratives about the state’s condition. Over time, this evolved into the structured collection of numerical data to meet the growing demands of modern governance, societal debate, and academic inquiry. Recognizing this cultural and historical foundation enriches the learning process, allowing students to appreciate how statistical methods evolved to meet the needs of science, governance, and society. This historical perspective also emphasizes the dual nature of statistics: as a descriptive tool for summarizing reality and as a mathematical discipline for making inferences from data. These advances have been pivotal not only in academia but also in practical fields like economics, sociology, and even fisheries management (see Section 3).\nMoreover, teaching statistics critically includes addressing its philosophical underpinnings. Statistics bridges the certainty of mathematics with the uncertainty of empirical observations. It equips students to navigate complex phenomena by identifying patterns and relationships while acknowledging inherent limitations. Highlighting these aspects encourages students to view statistics as a reflective, rather than purely technical, discipline.\nThrough cooperative and interactive learning approaches, I aim to empower students with the skills to interpret and critically evaluate statistical information. This involves fostering mathematical literacy and numeracy, ensuring that students can engage with statistical representations in the media and everyday life. By embedding these practices in teaching, I seek to cultivate informed students who can actively participate in data-driven decision-making processes (see Section 2 and Section 7).\n\nConstructive Alignment in Teaching\nConstructive alignment, as described by Biggs (1996), is a teaching framework that integrates constructivist learning theory with instructional design (Cohen 1987). It emphasizes the centrality of the learner’s activities in creating meaning, advocating that teaching, learning activities, and assessment methods must align to achieve intended learning outcomes. This approach requires defining course objectives that represent high cognitive levels and designing activities and assessments that elicit and measure these outcomes effectively.\nAt its core, constructive alignment shifts the focus from traditional teaching methods, where the teacher transmits knowledge, to a learner-centered model. It encourages students to actively engage with content, construct their understanding, and apply their learning in novel contexts. The alignment between objectives, activities, and assessments ensures that students not only acquire knowledge but also develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\nFor instance, assessments are designed not just to test memory or procedural skills but to evaluate “performances of understanding,” such as applying theories to real-world problems or reflecting on learning processes. This holistic alignment fosters deeper learning and prepares students for professional challenges (see Section 5).\nIn my teaching, the principles of constructive alignment resonate deeply. My integration of coding tasks into assessments (see Section 5) and my emphasis on hands-on data analysis (see Section 3) align with this framework, ensuring that students achieve both theoretical understanding and practical competence (Biggs 2011).\n\n\nFostering Conceptual Understanding\nMy teaching approach prioritizes conceptual understanding over rote memorization. I focus on enabling students to understand the underlying principles of econometric and statistical methods, ensuring they grasp the “why” behind the techniques they use. This approach moves beyond procedural learning to a deeper comprehension of concepts (see Section 1).\nConceptual understanding in statistics involves equipping students with the ability to make decisions about data visualization, exploration, and analysis. As emphasized in statistical education literature, students must develop a strong grasp of core concepts like variability, bias, randomness, distribution, and inference. These foundational ideas provide a framework for using tools and procedures effectively. For example, understanding variability allows students to appreciate the inherent differences in data, while knowledge of randomness helps them recognize its role in drawing valid conclusions.\nTo foster this understanding, I emphasize an investigative approach to learning. Students are encouraged to think critically about how data is collected, explore the questions it seeks to answer, and examine its implications. For instance, I guide them to consider why certain methods are chosen, how data limitations might affect results, and what alternative interpretations may exist. By focusing on these higher-order questions, students learn to connect statistical methods with real-world applications (see Section 5).\nIn line with Dysthe (2001) emphasis on dialogic learning, my teaching philosophy recognizes the centrality of dialogue and interaction in fostering deep learning. Dysthe’s framework highlights how learning is co-constructed through meaningful exchanges among students, teachers, and the wider learning environment. By creating opportunities for collaborative problem-solving and peer discussions, I aim to transform the classroom into a dialogic space where diverse perspectives contribute to understanding (Brooman, Darwent, and Pimor 2015).\nThis approach aligns with my use of collaborative assignments, hands-on coding projects (see Section 3), and my emphasis on student engagement through mid-term feedback (see Section 7). I also supervise students on their term papers and strive to provide as much individual feedback as possible on assignments, ensuring personalized guidance in their learning journey. Encouraging students to reflect on their learning processes, share their insights, and challenge each other’s ideas not only deepens their understanding but also equips them with critical thinking and communication skills essential for professional success.\nAnother key element is the use of engaging examples and case studies that highlight the role of econometrics as an exploratory and decision-making tool. These examples illustrate that econometrics is not merely a set of disconnected formulas but a coherent process aimed at uncovering insights from data. For instance, analyzing real-world datasets can help students see how statistical models are built and validated, and how they inform decisions in various domains (see Section 2).\n\n\nIntegrating Real Data and Context\nOne of my primary goals is to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application. By integrating real-world data into coursework, students learn to appreciate the relevance of statistical tools in solving complex problems. This approach not only enhances engagement but also prepares students to tackle real-world challenges effectively (see Section 2 and Section 3).\nIn my teaching, I often incorporate authentic datasets from official sources such as Statistics Norway (Statistisk Sentralbyrå, SSB). For example, I have used data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita from SSB to illustrate growth trends and economic concepts. Students are introduced to tools like APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to extract data directly from online repositories. This hands-on approach enables students to work with real data and enhances their technical skills in data extraction, cleaning, and visualization (see Section 3).\nTo further contextualize the data, I encourage students to examine the underlying economic theories and mathematical foundations. For instance, while analyzing GDP data, students explore concepts such as relative and percentage changes, and they learn to compute and interpret these metrics using logarithmic transformations. These activities reinforce the importance of critical thinking and the ability to connect quantitative analysis with theoretical frameworks.\nVisual representation of data plays a significant role in making the material accessible and engaging. Students create and refine graphical presentations of their findings, such as time-series plots of GDP growth rates. This practice not only improves their technical proficiency in tools like R and Python but also helps them communicate complex ideas effectively (see Section 2).\nA very critical principle I emphasize is the use of reproducible code in data analysis (Ram 2013). By employing tools that allow for the automatic updating of data, charts, and analysis each time the code is rerun, students learn to create dynamic and adaptable workflows. This approach mirrors real-world practices and highlights the limitations of static “point-and-click” software or Excel-based analyses. Reproducible workflows not only ensure consistency and transparency but also enable students to adapt their analyses as new data becomes available, fostering a deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of economic and societal systems (see Section 3).\n\n\nEmphasizing Multivariable Thinking\nEconomics, as a discipline, is deeply interconnected with societal structures and behaviors (Pühringer and Bäuerle 2019). When teaching multivariable thinking, I emphasize the importance of examining the big picture to understand how different components of society interact with the economy. This approach involves exploring how variables such as income levels, government policies, market structures, and global trends jointly influence economic outcomes and price formations.\nFor instance, students analyze datasets that involve multiple economic indicators, such as GDP, inflation rates, and unemployment levels, to uncover interdependencies. Through this process, they learn to construct and interpret models that reflect real-world economic complexities. By incorporating data visualization tools, students create multidimensional graphs that display relationships between variables, fostering a deeper understanding of how societal factors contribute to economic trends (see Section 1).\nTo further enhance multivariable thinking, I encourage students to engage in scenario analyses. For example, they may investigate how changes in taxation policies impact both consumer behavior and market prices. Such exercises help students recognize the dynamic nature of economic systems and the need for holistic perspectives when addressing policy questions or business challenges (see Section 2).\nThe ultimate goal is to cultivate a mindset where students appreciate the interconnectedness of societal and economic phenomena. This approach not only sharpens their analytical skills but also prepares them to contribute meaningfully to discussions on economic policy and societal development.\n\n\nActive Learning and Collaboration\nActive learning lies at the heart of my teaching philosophy, sparked by my own research with a colleague (Bertheussen and Myrland 2016). The only way for students to truly master the practical and applied aspects of econometrics, statistics, and data science is through consistent practice. I have integrated assignments as a cornerstone of all my classes, allowing students to engage directly with the material and apply their knowledge in meaningful ways.\nInitially, my teaching approach was rooted in traditional “talk and chalk” methods. However, I observed that while these methods helped students understand theoretical concepts, many struggled to translate their understanding into practical skills. To address this gap, I adopted a more interactive approach, incorporating hands-on activities and collaborative assignments (Becker and Watts 1998). These activities challenge students to think critically, solve problems, and collaborate effectively with their peers (see Section 3).\nEach assignment is designed to mirror real-world scenarios, requiring students to apply theoretical concepts to data-driven problems. For example, students may analyze datasets to identify trends, create predictive models, or evaluate policy impacts. This approach not only solidifies their understanding of the material but also prepares them for the complexities of professional environments (see Section 2).\nThe importance of active learning is echoed in educational research, which highlights the benefits of experiential learning and student-centered approaches (Alderman, Towers, and Bannah 2012; Mandouit 2018). Fostering statistical literacy and thinking requires students to engage with real data in relevant contexts. By designing assignments that simulate scientific laboratories rather than traditional classrooms, I provide students with the tools to navigate the dynamic landscape of modern data analysis.\nCollaboration is another critical component of my teaching. Group assignments encourage students to share diverse perspectives, hone their communication skills, and learn from one another. These experiences mirror professional settings, where teamwork is essential for success. By working together, students not only deepen their understanding but also build essential interpersonal skills that will serve them throughout their careers (see Section 2).\n\n\nLeveraging Technology\nTechnology has been a cornerstone of my teaching philosophy since 2007, particularly through my advocacy for open-source software. By using tools such as R and Python, students gain access to powerful, cost-free platforms that eliminate the barriers of expensive licenses (see Section 4). Open-source tools ensure students can continue using these technologies beyond their academic journey, allowing them to apply their skills in professional environments without the constraints of proprietary software. This approach democratizes access to advanced analytical capabilities, fostering a more inclusive learning environment.\nIn 2017, I began using WISEflow, a SaaS2 solution for exams (see Section 5). This platform revolutionized how I assess students by enabling practical and applied testing in econometrics (Chance 2002). Before adopting WISEflow, exams primarily focused on theoretical understanding, which often led students to downplay the practical components of the course. With WISEflow, I can test students’ ability to implement statistical methods, analyze data, and interpret results, ensuring a more comprehensive evaluation of their skills.\nSince the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) in November 2022, I have integrated chatbots and tools such as GitHub Copilot into my teaching practices to assist students with coding. Historically, coding has been a challenging skill for students to develop, especially alongside the demands of mastering theoretical and mathematical concepts. The integration of LLM-powered tools into coding environments, such as integrated development environments (IDEs), has significantly reduced barriers to learning these skills. Students can now receive real-time assistance in writing, debugging, and refining their code, which accelerates their ability to adopt coding skills effectively.\nHowever, the main learning challenge has shifted towards teaching students how to critically evaluate and validate the suggestions provided by these tools. I emphasize the importance of reviewing and verifying the chatbot’s outputs to ensure accuracy and alignment with the problem at hand. By fostering critical thinking and coding literacy, I prepare students to use these tools responsibly and effectively in professional contexts.\nThe integration of LLMs, alongside other technological tools, enhances the learning process and equips students with the skills needed for the rapidly evolving digital landscape. This commitment to leveraging technology reflects my dedication to preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the future.\n\n\nEthical Considerations\nIn an era of data-driven decision-making, the ethical implications of data usage and analysis cannot be overstated. As a teacher, I emphasize the critical importance of ethical considerations in all aspects of statistical practice. This includes recognizing biases in data collection, ensuring transparency in analysis, and adhering to principles of fairness and accountability when interpreting results.\nOne key area I focus on is the potential for misrepresentation or misuse of data. Students learn to critically evaluate the quality and source of their data, considering questions such as: Who collected this data? What assumptions underlie its collection? What potential biases might influence its interpretation? This reflective approach ensures that students develop a conscientious mindset towards the power and responsibility that come with handling data.\nAnother significant aspect is teaching students about privacy and confidentiality. With growing concerns over data breaches and misuse, students explore frameworks for ensuring that personal or sensitive information is safeguarded during analysis. Through case studies and discussions, I highlight real-world examples of ethical dilemmas and encourage students to propose solutions grounded in established ethical guidelines.\nAs Scheaffer (1998) emphasized, statistical education must include the awareness of the societal impact of statistical methods. This means teaching students not only to be proficient analysts but also to act as ethical stewards of the data they handle.\nFinally, I incorporate discussions on the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making, especially in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Students are introduced to the concepts of algorithmic fairness and the risks of perpetuating biases through automated systems. By understanding these challenges, students are better prepared to contribute to a field that increasingly influences societal decisions.\n\n\nAssessment as a Tool for Learning\nAssessments in my courses are designed not only to evaluate student performance but also to enhance learning (Hubbard 1997). By integrating coding as an essential component, I aim to bridge theoretical mathematics with algorithmic thinking. Students are not only required to demonstrate their understanding of econometric and statistical concepts but also to implement these concepts programmatically using tools like Python and R (see Section 5).\nFor example, I incorporate exercises that use R or Python to solve mathematical problems, optimize functions, and model complex systems (Sierra 2020). This approach helps students transition from abstract mathematical reasoning to tangible, applied problem-solving skills. Additionally, version control tools such as Git and platforms like GitHub are integral to my courses (Beckman et al. 2021). Students learn to manage their code repositories, collaborate on projects, and integrate their work with our Learning Management System (LMS), Canvas. These practices mirror professional workflows, preparing students for careers in data-intensive fields.\nThe use of SaaS platforms, like WISEflow, further enhances the assessment process. Practical exams conducted on this platform allow me to test students’ applied skills in econometrics and data analysis (Pfannkuch and Wild (2000)). Beyond grading, WISEflow enables me to provide detailed feedback reports to students, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. This iterative feedback mechanism helps students refine their skills and deepen their understanding of the material.\nBy integrating coding, algorithmic thinking, and modern technological tools into assessments, I ensure that students gain a comprehensive, practical, and forward-looking education (Combs et al. 2008). I also use the same tools to automatically give students individual feedback on their performance in a class (see Section 6). These strategies not only measure student performance but also foster a continuous learning process that equips them with the skills to excel in academia and industry."

    "section": "Plans Ahead",
    "text": "Plans Ahead\nLooking forward, the master program in Economics with Data Science is incorporating cutting-edge machine learning techniques that extend beyond the traditional methodological toolbox typically available to economists (Varian 2014). These advancements are essential as we aim to equip students with the skills required to analyze complex and unstructured data, including text, which has become increasingly relevant in both research and industry (Bickley, Chan, and Torgler 2022).\nMy own research now includes using text as data (Gentzkow, Kelly, and Taddy 2019), leveraging advancements such as Large Language Models (LLMs). These tools have transformed how we analyze and interpret textual information, making them a necessary component of our teaching. By integrating LLMs into the curriculum, we provide students with the opportunity to work with text data in ways that were previously unattainable. For instance, students learn how to preprocess, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from text, ensuring they are well-prepared to navigate a data-rich, text-driven world.\nIn addition to teaching text analysis, we are also exploring how LLMs can support students in solving coding tasks. These tools have the potential to reduce the barriers students often face when learning to program, offering real-time assistance in debugging and refining their code. As part of this initiative, we are investigating ways to seamlessly incorporate LLMs into the teaching environment, ensuring they are used effectively as educational aids rather than shortcuts.\nBeyond the Economics with Data Science programs, coding skills are now being integrated into other programs at the Business School. This expansion reflects a broader shift toward embedding computational literacy across disciplines. I am committed to contributing to this development, ensuring that all students have access to the tools and training necessary for data-driven decision-making.\nFurthermore, many researchers and students at the Business School currently focus on traditional qualitative analysis. As the use of text analytics becomes more prevalent, there will be a growing need to support these individuals in transitioning to approaches that treat text as data suitable for computational analysis. By providing targeted training and resources, we can help staff and students adopt these methodologies, enriching their research capabilities and preparing them for the future of qualitative and mixed-methods research.\nThese plans represent a commitment to staying at the forefront of educational and technological innovation, ensuring that our students and staff are well-equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly evolving academic and professional landscape."
