    "text": "Core Principles of Teaching\nAs a university professor specializing in quantitative analysis—econometrics, statistics, data science, and finance—my teaching philosophy is guided by a commitment to cultivating statistical thinking2 and fostering an analytical mindset in students (Racine and Hyndman 2002). I believe in creating an educational environment where students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their learning journey (Smith 1998). This involves teaching as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision-making (see Section 3).\nStatistics, as both a methodology and a field of study, is deeply embedded in historical, philosophical, and political contexts. Recognizing this cultural and historical foundation enriches the learning process, allowing students to appreciate how statistical methods evolved to meet the needs of science, governance, and society. This historical perspective also emphasizes the dual nature of statistics: as a descriptive tool for summarizing reality and as a mathematical discipline for making inferences from data. Moreover, teaching statistics critically includes addressing its philosophical underpinnings. Statistics bridges the certainty of mathematics with the uncertainty of empirical observations. It equips students to navigate complex phenomena by identifying patterns and relationships while acknowledging inherent limitations. Highlighting these aspects encourages students to view statistics as a reflective, rather than purely technical, discipline.\nThrough cooperative and interactive learning approaches, I aim to empower students with the skills to interpret and critically evaluate statistical information. This involves fostering mathematical literacy and numeracy, ensuring that students can engage with statistical representations in the media and everyday life. By embedding these practices in teaching, I seek to cultivate informed students who can actively participate in data-driven decision-making processes (see Section 2 and Section 7)."

    "text": "Systematic Development Over Time\nA key dimension of my growth as an educator is that each significant pedagogical change has been triggered by an observed learning barrier, followed by a deliberate redesign, and then validated through feedback from students, colleagues, or institutional partners.

The timeline also reflects a broadening of scope—from individual course improvements to programme-level redesign and institutional infrastructure (Jupyter)—mirroring an increasing emphasis on collective development.\n\n\nMini-case 1: From misaligned assessment to WISEflow coding exams\nObserved problem: Before 2017, econometrics exams tested primarily theoretical understanding. Student feedback and my own supervision experience revealed that many students deprioritized the practical coding labs because “it won’t be on the exam.” This misalignment meant students entered their thesis work with weak applied skills.\nPedagogical change: When UiT introduced WISEflow in 2017, I saw an opportunity to redesign assessment. I developed a two-part exam format: a closed theoretical section and an open-book practical coding section where students write and execute R code on real data. This required extensive experimentation with the platform, including testing code submission formats and designing “drag-and-drop” interpretation tasks (see Section 5).\nCollegial dimension: I discussed the new exam design with colleagues teaching parallel courses, shared WISEflow templates, and presented the approach at a departmental meeting. Some colleagues subsequently adopted similar practical exam components in their own courses.\nResult and reflection: The grade data for SOK-3020 shows a positive trend in the share of B and C grades among business students after 2017 (see the chart in Section 0.6.8). More importantly, I observed a qualitative shift: students began engaging with coding exercises earlier in the semester, knowing that practical competence would be assessed. A key lesson was that constructive alignment is not just about what we teach but what we assess—students allocate effort in response to assessment signals. A dilemma I continue to grapple with is how to balance the complexity of the coding tasks: too simple and the assessment becomes trivial; too complex and it disadvantages students who are strong theoretically but less experienced with programming. I address this through careful calibration of task difficulty and by providing practice exams.\n\n\nMini-case 2: From a single course to a programme redesign\nObserved problem: The BED-2056 “Introduction to Data Science” course (2018–2021) was initially an elective with 16 students. Its rapid growth to 36 students by 2020 signaled strong unmet demand, but it also revealed a structural limitation: a single course could not adequately prepare economists for data-intensive work. Students reported that the skills learned in BED-2056 felt disconnected from other courses in the programme.\nPedagogical change: Together with my colleagues in the economics programme, I was one of the driving forces behind the redesign of the entire economics curriculum. This resulted in the “Economics with Data Science” bachelor programme (launched 2021) and the corresponding master programme (launched 2024). The key design principle was to embed programming and data analysis throughout the curriculum rather than isolating them in a single course (see Section 2).\nCollegial dimension: The programme development required sustained collaboration among economics faculty, dialogue with industry representatives and alumni, and joint decisions about learning outcomes, assessment forms, and technical infrastructure. I had a leading role in designing the course progression, the digital portfolio system, and the standardized Content Management System (CMS) for course presentation. Crucially, this was not a solo effort—the programme represents genuine collegial co-creation, with colleagues contributing course designs, providing feedback, and co-teaching.\nResult and reflection: The bachelor programme more than doubled applications in its first year and won the BFE faculty “Utdanningsprisen” (Teaching Award) in 2022. The deeper lesson, however, was that individual course innovation is necessary but insufficient: for students to develop coherent competence, the entire learning pathway must be aligned. A challenge I continue to reflect on is how to maintain programme coherence as individual courses evolve and as new colleagues join the teaching team. We address this through regular programme meetings and shared course templates.\n\n\nMini-case 3: From local installation barriers to shared infrastructure (Jupyter)\nObserved problem: First-year students spent disproportionate time troubleshooting software installations (R, Python, dependencies) rather than learning to code. This technical barrier was particularly discouraging for students without prior programming experience, creating an equity issue.\nPedagogical change: I initiated a collaboration with UiT’s IT department (particularly Roy Dragseth) to create a shared, browser-based coding environment. This evolved from the initial rstudio.uit.no (R only) to the current jupyter.uit.no platform supporting R, Python, SageMath, and SQL (see Section 4).\nCollegial dimension: This work illustrates collegial educational development: a teaching challenge in my own courses became a shared solution for multiple programmes across UiT through sustained collaboration with the IT department. The platform is now used by students and staff in many disciplines beyond economics, and the IT department continues to develop it—adding Julia and GPU-based PyTorch during 2025. These upgrades have been integrated into our new machine learning courses, giving students hands-on access to Julia and GPU-based PyTorch.\nResult and reflection: The most significant outcome is that the barrier to entry for coding has been dramatically lowered. Students can begin writing code in their first lecture. However, a limitation I have observed is that the cloud-based environment can create a dependency: some students do not learn to set up local development environments, which they may need in professional settings. We now include a brief module on local installation in advanced courses to address this gap.\n\n\nDilemmas and ongoing challenges\nThroughout this process, I have reflected on several dilemmas and challenges. Three stand out. First, the balance between coding and economics: as we integrate more programming, I must ensure that economic theory does not become secondary. I address this by designing coding tasks that are always in service of economic analysis, never programming for its own sake. Second, there is the question of sustainability and scaling: the approaches I have developed (practical exams, automated feedback, digital portfolios) require significant upfront investment in infrastructure and course design. Ensuring that these systems remain maintainable as I share them with colleagues is an ongoing concern. Third, the responsible integration of LLM’s: since 2022, tools like chatGPT and GitHub Copilot have transformed the coding learning environment. The pedagogical challenge has shifted from “how do we teach students to code?” to “how do we teach students to critically evaluate code generated by AI?” I am still developing my approach here, and I view this as the most significant teaching challenge of the coming years.\n\nA concrete example: the Cheese Case (SOK-3025, Fall 2025)\nIn a final master-level econometrics course before the thesis semester, I designed a term paper around a real pricing and promotion dataset for a U.S. cheese manufacturer. The case requires students to move from simple OLS estimation through panel data models (fixed effects, random effects, Mundlak) to profit-maximizing pricing and promotion evaluation—a progression that mirrors the complexity they will face in their thesis work.\nCrucially, I allowed full use of LLMs throughout the exercise. This was a deliberate pedagogical choice: I wanted students to discover for themselves the boundary between tasks where LLMs excel and tasks where they fail without informed human guidance. Traditional, highly structured textbook exercises—“estimate an OLS model on this dataset”—are easily solved by any modern LLM. But the Cheese Case demands that students make sequential modeling decisions, interpret results in economic context, and justify choices that depend on understanding the data structure. Simply pasting my questions into a chatbot did not produce adequate answers.\nThe student reflections after the exercise confirmed exactly this pattern. Several students reported that LLMs worked well for simple, early tasks—loading data, running basic regressions, producing plots—but became increasingly unreliable as the analysis required more complex panel models and economic interpretation. One student noted: the effort shifted “from coding itself to critical evaluation and validation of the machine’s suggestions.” Another observed that “when I didn’t fully know what I was looking for, it was not a useful tool.” A recurring theme was the discovery that prompt quality depends entirely on the student’s own conceptual understanding: without knowing which model to request and why, even well-formulated prompts produced elegant but irrelevant output.\nSeveral reflections also revealed a productive discomfort. Students described feeling that the work was “less mine” when heavily AI-assisted, and that the friction of debugging and re-prompting, while frustrating, generated deeper learning than a frictionless process would have. One student captured the core pedagogical insight precisely: “no matter how good AI is, you have to know what you are doing and verify the results afterwards.”\nThis experience has shaped my evolving approach to LLM integration. Rather than restricting AI use or ignoring it, I design tasks where the analytical judgment—choosing functional forms, recognizing panel structure, interpreting economic plausibility—cannot be outsourced. The LLM becomes a powerful assistant for implementation, but the student must remain the decision-maker. The Cheese Case demonstrated that this design works: students who engaged deeply with the econometric reasoning produced strong analyses regardless of which LLM they used, while those who relied on cut-and-paste prompting recognized their own knowledge gaps. Both outcomes are pedagogically valuable. I plan to develop more cases following this principle, where the complexity is in the thinking, not in the coding, and where LLM use is welcomed precisely because it makes visible who understands the underlying economics and who does not."

    "text": "Collegiality: Building Teaching Capacity with Others\nMy approach to teaching is intentionally “open” and collaborative. I share materials, invite critique, co-design teaching solutions, and contribute to infrastructure that lowers barriers for both students and colleagues. In practice, my collegiality is expressed through (i) co-teaching and mentoring, (ii) sharing reusable teaching resources (“open education principles3”), and (iii) collaborative educational development projects.\n\nCo-teaching, mentoring, and daily collegial support\nOver many years, I have co-taught courses with colleagues at different points in time, including courses in econometrics, market analysis, finance, statistics and data science. In these collaborations, I have taken responsibility for developing shared course materials, assessment rubrics, and coding templates that my co-teachers could adopt and adapt. I actively contribute as a sounding board on teaching design, assessment, and quantitative methods—not only within my own department but also when colleagues from other programmes seek advice on integrating data analysis into their courses4. My mentoring role extends beyond formal supervision. I have mentored junior colleagues in course design and exam development, sharing practical templates and providing feedback on their teaching approaches.\n\n\nOpen teaching and sharing of reusable resources\nI am a strong advocate of what I call “open teaching,” analogous to the open-source philosophy in software development. Concretely, this means that I routinely provide colleagues and students with reusable teaching materials, code templates, and reproducible course assets (e.g., Quarto documents, Git workflows, and standardized course pages). All course resources for the Economics with Data Science programmes are published on GitHub and remain accessible even after the course has ended (see, for example, the SOK-1004 course page: uit-sok-1004-h21.github.io). To support collegial reuse, I package course assets—templates, code, assignment scaffolds—in a way that colleagues can adopt directly, and I actively invite peer feedback to improve them over time. This reduces duplication of effort, enables quality improvement through peer reuse, and supports a culture of transparency and continuous refinement.\n\n\nCollegial educational development at UiT\nThe co-development of the “Economics with Data Science” programmes required sustained collegial collaboration across the economics programme, with shared design work on learning outcomes, assessment forms, and technical infrastructure. I had one of the leading roles in this process, during programme meetings, drafting learning outcome descriptions, and designing the course progression. This was fundamentally a team effort: colleagues contributed their own expertise, challenged proposals, and co-created the final programme structure.\nSimilarly, the establishment of UiT-wide coding infrastructure (Jupyter) was achieved through close collaboration with the IT department, turning a local teaching need into a shared institutional resource. I also initiated and contributed to internal workshops on practical coding assessment and the use of WISEflow, sharing my experience so that colleagues could benefit from what I had learned through trial and error.\n\n\nDissemination beyond the local context\nI have published a co-authored article on digital learning (Bertheussen and Myrland 2016) and have shared my teaching experiences through internal presentations and workshops at UiT. I recognize that there is a potential for more formal dissemination—through conferences on higher education and additional scholarly publications on teaching and learning. This is an area I plan to develop further (see the “Plans Ahead” section)."

    "section": "Core Principles of Teaching (continued)",
    "text": "Core Principles of Teaching (continued)\n\nConstructive Alignment in Teaching\nConstructive alignment, as developed by Biggs (1996) and elaborated in Biggs and Tang (2011), provides the theoretical foundation for integrating learning theory with instructional design. This framework, building on constructivist learning principles (Cohen 1987), establishes that effective learning occurs when teaching methods, learning activities, and assessment practices work in harmony to support intended learning outcomes.\nThe SOLO (Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes) taxonomy, a key component of constructive alignment theory (Biggs and Tang 2011), has guided my course design, particularly in the progression of learning activities. For example, in my econometrics courses, students advance from understanding basic statistical concepts (unistructural) to analyzing complex economic relationships (relational), and finally to creating original analyses using multiple data sources. This progression aligns with Wang et al. (2013) findings on the effectiveness of structured learning progressions in higher education.\nAt its core, constructive alignment transforms traditional teacher-centered instruction into a learner-centered model. In my WISEflow assessments (see Section 5), students demonstrate their understanding not through mere reproduction of knowledge, but through practical application of economic theories to real-world data analysis problems. This approach exemplifies what Biggs and Tang (2011) describe as “performances of understanding”—assessments that require students to actively demonstrate their grasp of concepts through meaningful application (also see Gardner (1993); Wiske (1998)).\nThe implementation of constructive alignment in my teaching is particularly evident in my integration of coding tasks and hands-on data analysis (see Section 3). These activities are deliberately structured to align with both the theoretical foundations of economics and the practical skills demanded by the profession. Students progress through carefully sequenced learning activities that build upon each other, from basic coding exercises to complex economic analyses, ensuring that assessment tasks authentically reflect the learning objectives.\n\n\nFostering Conceptual Understanding\nMy teaching approach prioritizes conceptual understanding over rote memorization. I focus on enabling students to understand the underlying principles of econometric and statistical methods, ensuring they grasp the “why” behind the techniques they use (see Section 1).\nConceptual understanding in statistics involves equipping students with the ability to make decisions about data visualization, exploration, and analysis. Students must develop a strong grasp of core concepts like variability, bias, randomness, distribution, and inference. To foster this understanding, I emphasize an investigative approach to learning. Students are encouraged to think critically about how data is collected, explore the questions it seeks to answer, and examine its implications (see Section 5).\nIn line with Dysthe (2001) emphasis on dialogic learning, my teaching philosophy recognizes the centrality of dialogue and interaction in fostering deep learning. Dysthe’s framework highlights how learning is co-constructed through meaningful exchanges among students, teachers, and the wider learning environment. By creating opportunities for collaborative problem-solving and peer discussions, I aim to transform the classroom into a dialogic space where diverse perspectives contribute to understanding (Brooman, Darwent, and Pimor 2015).\nThis approach aligns with my use of collaborative assignments, hands-on coding projects (see Section 3), and my emphasis on student engagement through mid-term feedback (see Section 7). I also supervise students on their term papers and strive to provide as much individual feedback as possible on assignments, ensuring personalized guidance in their learning journey (see Section 8 for a fuller discussion of my supervision practice).\n\n\nIntegrating Real Data and Context\nOne of my primary goals is to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, following Brown, Collins, and Duguid (1989) situated learning framework, which emphasizes that knowledge is inseparable from its context of use. By integrating real-world data into coursework, students learn to appreciate the relevance of statistical tools in solving complex problems (Libman 2010; Herrington 2005). This approach creates what Brown, Collins, and Duguid (1989) describe as an “authentic activity” for learning (see Section 2 and Section 3).\nIn my teaching, I incorporate authentic datasets from official sources such as Statistics Norway (SSB), exemplifying Herrington’s principles of authentic learning environments (Herrington 2005). Students are introduced to tools like APIs to extract data directly from online repositories, engaging in what Brown, Collins, and Duguid (1989) term “legitimate peripheral participation” in real economic analysis (also see Lave and Wenger (1991)). This hands-on approach enables students to work with real data and enhances their technical skills in data extraction, cleaning, and visualization (see Section 3).\nA critical principle I emphasize is the use of reproducible code in data analysis (Ram 2013). By employing tools that allow for the automatic updating of data, charts, and analysis each time the code is rerun, students learn to create dynamic and adaptable workflows. This approach mirrors real-world practices and highlights the limitations of static “point-and-click” software. Reproducible workflows ensure consistency and transparency and enable students to adapt their analyses as new data becomes available (see Section 3).\n\n\nEmphasizing Multivariable Thinking\nEconomics is deeply interconnected with societal structures and behaviors (Pühringer and Bäuerle 2019). When teaching multivariable thinking, I emphasize examining the big picture to understand how different components of society interact with the economy. Students analyze datasets that involve multiple economic indicators—GDP, inflation rates, unemployment levels—to uncover interdependencies. Through this process, they learn to construct and interpret models that reflect real-world economic complexities (see Section 1).\nTo further enhance multivariable thinking, I encourage students to engage in scenario analyses. For example, they may investigate how changes in taxation policies impact both consumer behavior and market prices. Such exercises help students recognize the dynamic nature of economic systems and the need for holistic perspectives when addressing policy questions (see Section 2).\n\n\nActive Learning and Collaboration\nActive learning lies at the heart of my teaching philosophy, sparked by my own research with a colleague (Bertheussen and Myrland 2016). This approach resonates with (Laurillard 2012) Conversational Framework, which emphasizes the importance of dialogue and iterative interaction in the learning process. The only way for students to truly master the practical and applied aspects of econometrics, statistics, and data science is through consistent, structured practice within their zone of proximal development (Vygotsky 1978).\nInitially, my teaching approach was rooted in traditional “talk and chalk” methods. However, I observed that while these methods helped students understand theoretical concepts, many struggled to translate their understanding into practical skills. To address this gap, I adopted a more interactive approach, incorporating hands-on activities and collaborative assignments (Becker and Watts 1998; Henderson, Ryan, and Phillips 2019). Each assignment is designed to mirror real-world scenarios, requiring students to apply theoretical concepts to data-driven problems. Following the principles of situated learning (Laurillard 2012), students analyze datasets to identify trends, create predictive models, or evaluate policy impacts (see Section 2).\nCollaboration, grounded in social constructivist learning theory, is another critical component (Henderson, Ryan, and Phillips 2019). Group assignments encourage students to share diverse perspectives, hone their communication skills, and learn from one another through peer scaffolding. By working together, students not only deepen their understanding but also build essential interpersonal skills that will serve them throughout their careers (see Section 2).\n\n\nLeveraging Technology\nTechnology has been a cornerstone of my teaching philosophy, guided by the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework (Koehler and Mishra 2009). Through my advocacy for open-source software like R and Python, students gain access to powerful, cost-free platforms that eliminate the barriers of expensive licenses (see Section 4). Following Hoyt and McGoldrick (2012) recommendations for economics education, these open-source tools ensure students can continue using these technologies beyond their academic journey.\nIn 2017, I began using WISEflow, a SaaS solution for exams (see Section 5). Aligned with TPACK principles (Koehler and Mishra 2009), this platform revolutionized how I assess students by enabling practical and applied testing in econometrics (Chance 2002). Before adopting WISEflow, exams primarily focused on theoretical understanding, which often led students to downplay the practical components of the course.\nSince the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) in November 2022, I have integrated chatbots and tools such as GitHub Copilot into my teaching practices. The main learning challenge has shifted towards teaching students how to critically evaluate and validate the suggestions provided by these tools. I emphasize the importance of reviewing and verifying the chatbot’s outputs to ensure accuracy, fostering critical thinking and coding literacy that prepares students to use these tools responsibly.\n\n\nEthical Considerations\nIn an era of data-driven decision-making, the ethical implications of data usage cannot be overstated. I emphasize the critical importance of ethical considerations in all aspects of statistical practice: recognizing biases in data collection, ensuring transparency in analysis, and adhering to principles of fairness and accountability when interpreting results. Students learn to critically evaluate the quality and source of their data and explore frameworks for ensuring that personal or sensitive information is safeguarded during analysis. As Scheaffer (1998) emphasized, statistical education must include the awareness of the societal impact of statistical methods. I also incorporate discussions on the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making, especially in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\n\nAssessment as a Tool for Learning\nAssessments in my courses follow Black and Wiliam (1998) formative assessment framework, designed not only to evaluate student performance but also to enhance learning through continuous feedback loops (Hubbard 1997). By integrating coding as an essential component, I bridge theoretical mathematics with algorithmic thinking, creating what Black and Wiliam (1998) term “moment of learning” where assessment directly informs instruction. Students demonstrate their understanding of econometric and statistical concepts while implementing these concepts programmatically using Python and R (see Section 5).\nAdditionally, version control tools such as Git and platforms like GitHub are integral to my courses (Beckman et al. 2021). Students learn to manage their code repositories, collaborate on projects, and integrate their work with our Learning Management System (LMS), Canvas, creating what Black and Wiliam (1998) describe as a “formative assessment practice.”\nThe figure below demonstrates the effectiveness of this assessment approach, showing the aggregate percentile for grades C and B in SOK-3020 Econometrics for business students. The positive trend after 2017 aligns with Ihantola et al. (2015)’s findings on the benefits of integrated programming assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy integrating coding, algorithmic thinking, and modern technological tools into assessments, I ensure that students gain a comprehensive, practical, and forward-looking education (Combs et al. 2008). I also use these tools to automatically generate individual feedback on student performance (see Section 6), implementing what Black and Wiliam (1998) describe as “assessment for learning” rather than merely assessment of learning."

    "text": "Plans Ahead\nLooking forward, the master programme in Economics with Data Science is incorporating cutting-edge machine learning techniques that extend beyond the traditional methodological toolbox typically available to economists (Varian 2014). My own research now includes using text as data (Gentzkow, Kelly, and Taddy 2019), leveraging advancements such as Large Language Models (LLMs). By integrating LLMs into the curriculum, we provide students with the opportunity to work with text data in ways that were previously unattainable.\nWe are also exploring how LLMs can support students in solving coding tasks and how they can be used to programmatically provide feedback on student assignments. We have initiated work on automated feedback systems that leverage LLMs to provide detailed, contextual responses to student assignments, while maintaining rigorous academic standards and promoting genuine learning.\nBeyond the Economics with Data Science programmes, coding skills are now being integrated into other programmes at the Business School. I am committed to contributing to this development, ensuring that all students have access to the tools and training necessary for data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, many researchers and students at the Business School currently focus on traditional qualitative analysis. Building on this shift, a colleague and I have provided targeted training and shared resources that help colleagues, Phd’s and master’s students adopt computational text analysis methods.\nI also plan to co-author a scholarly article on the design and learning outcomes of the Economics with Data Science econometrics course, contributing to the growing literature on data science in economics education."
