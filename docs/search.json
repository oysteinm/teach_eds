    "text": "My name is Øystein Myrland, from Andenes in Nordland. I am a professor (since 2007) of Economics at The School of Business and Economics. My long-term relationship with UiT The Arctic University of Norway dates back to my enrollment as a student back in 1986. During my studies, I was introduced to teaching during study groups, where I often ended up lecturing my fellow students during sessions—a role I found both stimulating and very engaging. This early experience sparked my passion for teaching, a commitment that has only deepened over the years. As you will notice, most of this document is written in English. The reason for this is that the majority of my current and historical classes, mainly at the master’s and PhD level, have been taught in English, largely because they are part of the Erasmus program—a European Union initiative to support education, training, and international exchange. Additionally, all my research is conducted and published in English. Only recently have I begun teaching in Norwegian at the bachelor’s level, marking an interesting shift in my teaching journey, transitioning from teaching advanced topics to guiding students through foundational concepts.\nI began my formal teaching career during my PhD project in 1996, with a strong emphasis on quantitative courses. Early in my career, I taught econometrics and market analysis courses using proprietary software like Shazam (Byron 1987), SPSS (Hilbe 2003, 2004, 2005), and Stata (Gutierrez 2010) for the traditionally required empirical “data labs” (Kaplan 2018). Recognizing the growing potential of open-source tools, I started using R in 2007 (R Core Team 2024) and fully integrated it into my quantitative courses by 2015. This transition was driven by my belief in equipping students with accessible, practical tools that bridge theory and application (see Section 1).\nThroughout my teaching journey, I noticed a recurring challenge: students often focused solely on exam-related content, neglecting the practical application of statistical software and coding skills. This gap became evident when supervising master’s students who excelled in theoretical exams but lacked hands-on experience during the practical work on their master thesis. The introduction of the WISEflow digital assessment platform in 2017 provided an opportunity to address this (see Section 5). By incorporating practical coding tasks into exams, I ensured that students developed not only theoretical knowledge but also the applied skills essential for real-world problem-solving.\nThis evolution in my teaching approach reflects my dedication to fostering a learning environment that combines rigorous academic theory with practical applications. My journey has been one of continual adaptation, driven by a commitment to student growth and the evolving demands of the disciplines I teach.\nOver the years, I have supervised more than 50 master’s students and 11 PhD students, all of whom have successfully completed their degrees. Currently, I am supervising two PhD candidates, continuing my commitment to mentoring the next generation of researchers and professionals. My formal educational training includes the “Universitetspedagogisk seminar” (UPS) at UiT in 2002 and “Forskningsveiledning” at UiT Result in 2021, both of which have significantly influenced my teaching and supervisory approach.\nThis document outlines my academic teaching journey, which began with a traditional “talk and chalk” approach to teaching quantitative subjects, focusing on mathematics and formal procedures—the same way I was taught. However, over time, my teaching philosophy has evolved significantly. I now prioritize “statistical thinking” and the practical application of quantitative analysis.

    "section": "Core Principles of Teaching",
    "text": "Core Principles of Teaching\nAs a university professor specializing in quantitative analysis like econometrics, statistics, data science, and finance, my teaching philosophy is guided by a commitment to cultivating statistical thinking1 and fostering an analytical mindset in students (Racine and Hyndman 2002). I believe in creating an educational environment where students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their learning journey (Smith 1998). This involves teaching as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision-making (see Section 3).\nStatistics, as both a methodology and a field of study, is deeply embedded in historical, philosophical, and political contexts. Traditionally linked to the administration and governance of the state, statistics initially encompassed broad descriptive narratives about the state’s condition. Over time, this evolved into the structured collection of numerical data to meet the growing demands of modern governance, societal debate, and academic inquiry. Recognizing this cultural and historical foundation enriches the learning process, allowing students to appreciate how statistical methods evolved to meet the needs of science, governance, and society. This historical perspective also emphasizes the dual nature of statistics: as a descriptive tool for summarizing reality and as a mathematical discipline for making inferences from data. These advances have been pivotal not only in academia but also in practical fields like economics, sociology, and even fisheries management (see Section 3).\nMoreover, teaching statistics critically includes addressing its philosophical underpinnings. Statistics bridges the certainty of mathematics with the uncertainty of empirical observations. It equips students to navigate complex phenomena by identifying patterns and relationships while acknowledging inherent limitations. Highlighting these aspects encourages students to view statistics as a reflective, rather than purely technical, discipline.\nThrough cooperative and interactive learning approaches, I aim to empower students with the skills to interpret and critically evaluate statistical information. This involves fostering mathematical literacy and numeracy, ensuring that students can engage with statistical representations in the media and everyday life. By embedding these practices in teaching, I seek to cultivate informed students who can actively participate in data-driven decision-making processes (see Section 2 and Section 7).\n\nConstructive Alignment in Teaching\nConstructive alignment, as developed by Biggs (1996) and elaborated in Biggs and Tang (2011), provides the theoretical foundation for integrating learning theory with instructional design. This framework, building on constructivist learning principles (Cohen 1987), establishes that effective learning occurs when teaching methods, learning activities, and assessment practices work in harmony to support intended learning outcomes. The framework particularly emphasizes how students construct meaning through their engagement with carefully designed learning activities.\nThe SOLO (Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes) taxonomy, a key component of constructive alignment theory (Biggs and Tang 2011), has guided my course design, particularly in the progression of learning activities. For example, in my econometrics courses, students advance from understanding basic statistical concepts (unistructural) to analyzing complex economic relationships (relational), and finally to creating original analyses using multiple data sources. This progression aligns with Wang et al. (2013) findings on the effectiveness of structured learning progressions in higher education.\nAt its core, constructive alignment transforms traditional teacher-centered instruction into a learner-centered model. This transformation manifests in my teaching through carefully designed learning sequences where each element reinforces the others. For instance, in my WISEflow assessments (see Section 5), students demonstrate their understanding not through mere reproduction of knowledge, but through practical application of economic theories to real-world data analysis problems. This approach exemplifies what Biggs and Tang (2011) describe as “performances of understanding” - assessments that require students to actively demonstrate their grasp of concepts through meaningful application.\nThe implementation of constructive alignment in my teaching is particularly evident in my integration of coding tasks and hands-on data analysis (see Section 3). These activities are deliberately structured to align with both the theoretical foundations of economics and the practical skills demanded by the profession. Students progress through carefully sequenced learning activities that build upon each other, from basic coding exercises to complex economic analyses, ensuring that assessment tasks authentically reflect the learning objectives and professional competencies they are meant to develop.\nThis systematic alignment between learning objectives, teaching activities, and assessment methods has produced demonstrable improvements in student learning outcomes, particularly in their ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems. The success of this approach is reflected in both student performance and their readiness for professional challenges, supporting Biggs and Tang (2011)’s assertion that proper constructive alignment leads to deeper, more meaningful learning experiences.\n\n\n\nFostering Conceptual Understanding\nMy teaching approach prioritizes conceptual understanding over rote memorization. I focus on enabling students to understand the underlying principles of econometric and statistical methods, ensuring they grasp the “why” behind the techniques they use. This approach moves beyond procedural learning to a deeper comprehension of concepts (see Section 1).\nConceptual understanding in statistics involves equipping students with the ability to make decisions about data visualization, exploration, and analysis. As emphasized in statistical education literature, students must develop a strong grasp of core concepts like variability, bias, randomness, distribution, and inference. These foundational ideas provide a framework for using tools and procedures effectively. For example, understanding variability allows students to appreciate the inherent differences in data, while knowledge of randomness helps them recognize its role in drawing valid conclusions.\nTo foster this understanding, I emphasize an investigative approach to learning. Students are encouraged to think critically about how data is collected, explore the questions it seeks to answer, and examine its implications. For instance, I guide them to consider why certain methods are chosen, how data limitations might affect results, and what alternative interpretations may exist. By focusing on these higher-order questions, students learn to connect statistical methods with real-world applications (see Section 5).\nIn line with Dysthe (2001) emphasis on dialogic learning, my teaching philosophy recognizes the centrality of dialogue and interaction in fostering deep learning. Dysthe’s framework highlights how learning is co-constructed through meaningful exchanges among students, teachers, and the wider learning environment. By creating opportunities for collaborative problem-solving and peer discussions, I aim to transform the classroom into a dialogic space where diverse perspectives contribute to understanding (Brooman, Darwent, and Pimor 2015).\nThis approach aligns with my use of collaborative assignments, hands-on coding projects (see Section 3), and my emphasis on student engagement through mid-term feedback (see Section 7). I also supervise students on their term papers and strive to provide as much individual feedback as possible on assignments, ensuring personalized guidance in their learning journey. Encouraging students to reflect on their learning processes, share their insights, and challenge each other’s ideas not only deepens their understanding but also equips them with critical thinking and communication skills essential for professional success.\nAnother key element is the use of engaging examples and case studies that highlight the role of econometrics as an exploratory and decision-making tool. These examples illustrate that econometrics is not merely a set of disconnected formulas but a coherent process aimed at uncovering insights from data. For instance, analyzing real-world datasets can help students see how statistical models are built and validated, and how they inform decisions in various domains (see Section 2).\n\n\nIntegrating Real Data and Context\nOne of my primary goals is to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, following Brown, Collins, and Duguid (1989) situated learning framework, which emphasizes that knowledge is inseparable from its context of use. By integrating real-world data into coursework, students learn to appreciate the relevance of statistical tools in solving complex problems (Libman 2010; Herrington 2005). This approach creates what Brown, Collins, and Duguid (1989) describe as an “authentic activity” for learning, preparing students to tackle real-world challenges effectively (see Section 2 and Section 3).\nIn my teaching, I often incorporate authentic datasets from official sources such as Statistics Norway (Statistisk Sentralbyrå, SSB), exemplifying Herrington’s principles of authentic learning environments (Herrington 2005). For example, I have used data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita from SSB to illustrate growth trends and economic concepts. Students are introduced to tools like APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to extract data directly from online repositories, engaging in what Brown, Collins, and Duguid (1989) term “legitimate peripheral participation” in real economic analysis. This hands-on approach enables students to work with real data and enhances their technical skills in data extraction, cleaning, and visualization (see Section 3).\nTo further contextualize the data, I encourage students to examine the underlying economic theories and mathematical foundations. For instance, while analyzing GDP data, students explore concepts such as relative and percentage changes, and they learn to compute and interpret these metrics using logarithmic transformations. These activities reinforce the importance of critical thinking and the ability to connect quantitative analysis with theoretical frameworks (Carter et al. 2011), creating what Herrington terms “authentic activities” (Herrington 2005).\nVisual representation of data plays a significant role in making the material accessible and engaging. Students create and refine graphical presentations of their findings, such as time-series plots of GDP growth rates. This practice not only improves their technical proficiency in tools like R and Python but also helps them communicate complex ideas effectively (see Section 2).\nA very critical principle I emphasize is the use of reproducible code in data analysis (Ram 2013). By employing tools that allow for the automatic updating of data, charts, and analysis each time the code is rerun, students learn to create dynamic and adaptable workflows. This approach mirrors real-world practices and highlights the limitations of static “point-and-click” software or Excel-based analyses. Reproducible workflows not only ensure consistency and transparency but also enable students to adapt their analyses as new data becomes available, fostering a deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of economic and societal systems (see Section 3).\n\n\n\nEmphasizing Multivariable Thinking\nEconomics, as a discipline, is deeply interconnected with societal structures and behaviors (Pühringer and Bäuerle 2019). When teaching multivariable thinking, I emphasize the importance of examining the big picture to understand how different components of society interact with the economy. This approach involves exploring how variables such as income levels, government policies, market structures, and global trends jointly influence economic outcomes and price formations.\nFor instance, students analyze datasets that involve multiple economic indicators, such as GDP, inflation rates, and unemployment levels, to uncover interdependencies. Through this process, they learn to construct and interpret models that reflect real-world economic complexities. By incorporating data visualization tools, students create multidimensional graphs that display relationships between variables, fostering a deeper understanding of how societal factors contribute to economic trends (see Section 1).\nTo further enhance multivariable thinking, I encourage students to engage in scenario analyses. For example, they may investigate how changes in taxation policies impact both consumer behavior and market prices. Such exercises help students recognize the dynamic nature of economic systems and the need for holistic perspectives when addressing policy questions or business challenges (see Section 2).\nThe ultimate goal is to cultivate a mindset where students appreciate the interconnectedness of societal and economic phenomena. This approach not only sharpens their analytical skills but also prepares them to contribute meaningfully to discussions on economic policy and societal development.\n\n\nActive Learning and Collaboration\nActive learning lies at the heart of my teaching philosophy, sparked by my own research with a colleague (Bertheussen and Myrland 2016). This approach resonates with (Laurillard 2012) Conversational Framework, which builds on social constructivist principles by emphasizing the importance of dialogue and iterative interaction in the learning process. The only way for students to truly master the practical and applied aspects of econometrics, statistics, and data science is through consistent, structured practice within their zone of proximal development (Vygotsky 1978).\nInitially, my teaching approach was rooted in traditional “talk and chalk” methods. However, I observed that while these methods helped students understand theoretical concepts, many struggled to translate their understanding into practical skills. To address this gap, I adopted a more interactive approach, incorporating hands-on activities and collaborative assignments (Becker and Watts 1998; Henderson, Ryan, and Phillips 2019). These activities challenge students to think critically, solve problems, and collaborate effectively with their peers (see Section 3).\nEach assignment is designed to mirror real-world scenarios, requiring students to apply theoretical concepts to data-driven problems. Following the principles of situated learning (Laurillard 2012), students analyze datasets to identify trends, create predictive models, or evaluate policy impacts. This approach not only solidifies their understanding of the material but also prepares them for the complexities of professional environments (see Section 2).\nThe importance of active learning is echoed in educational research, which highlights the benefits of experiential learning and student-centered approaches (Alderman, Towers, and Bannah 2012; Mandouit 2018). Fostering statistical literacy and thinking requires students to engage with real data in relevant contexts. By designing assignments that simulate scientific laboratories rather than traditional classrooms, I provide students with the tools to navigate the dynamic landscape of modern data analysis.\nCollaboration, grounded in social constructivist learning theory, is another critical component of my teaching (Henderson, Ryan, and Phillips 2019). Group assignments encourage students to share diverse perspectives, hone their communication skills, and learn from one another through peer scaffolding. These experiences mirror professional settings, where teamwork is essential for success. By working together, students not only deepen their understanding but also build essential interpersonal skills that will serve them throughout their careers (see Section 2).\n\n\n\nLeveraging Technology\nTechnology has been a cornerstone of my teaching philosophy, guided by the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework (Koehler and Mishra 2009). This framework emphasizes the complex interplay between technological knowledge, pedagogical approaches, and subject matter expertise in effective teaching. Through my advocacy for open-source software like R and Python, students gain access to powerful, cost-free platforms that eliminate the barriers of expensive licenses (see Section 4). Following Hoyt and McGoldrick (2012) recommendations for economics education, these open-source tools ensure students can continue using these technologies beyond their academic journey, applying their skills in professional environments without the constraints of proprietary software.\nIn 2017, I began using WISEflow, a SaaS2 solution for exams (see Section 5). Aligned with TPACK principles of integrating technology with pedagogical goals (Koehler and Mishra 2009), this platform revolutionized how I assess students by enabling practical and applied testing in econometrics (Chance 2002). Before adopting WISEflow, exams primarily focused on theoretical understanding, which often led students to downplay the practical components of the course. With WISEflow, I can test students’ ability to implement statistical methods, analyze data, and interpret results, ensuring a more comprehensive evaluation of their skills.\nSince the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) in November 2022, I have integrated chatbots and tools such as GitHub Copilot into my teaching practices, exemplifying what Hoyt and McGoldrick (2012) describe as adaptive technology integration in economics education. Historically, coding has been a challenging skill for students to develop, especially alongside the demands of mastering theoretical and mathematical concepts. The integration of LLM-powered tools into coding environments has significantly reduced barriers to learning these skills, while maintaining the careful balance between technological assistance and pedagogical objectives that TPACK emphasizes (Koehler and Mishra 2009).\nHowever, the main learning challenge has shifted towards teaching students how to critically evaluate and validate the suggestions provided by these tools. I emphasize the importance of reviewing and verifying the chatbot’s outputs to ensure accuracy and alignment with the problem at hand. By fostering critical thinking and coding literacy, I prepare students to use these tools responsibly and effectively in professional contexts.\nThe integration of LLMs, alongside other technological tools, enhances the learning process and equips students with the skills needed for the rapidly evolving digital landscape. This commitment to leveraging technology reflects my dedication to preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the future, while maintaining the careful balance between technological innovation and pedagogical effectiveness that the TPACK framework advocates (Koehler and Mishra 2009).\n\n\nEthical Considerations\nIn an era of data-driven decision-making, the ethical implications of data usage and analysis cannot be overstated. As a teacher, I emphasize the critical importance of ethical considerations in all aspects of statistical practice. This includes recognizing biases in data collection, ensuring transparency in analysis, and adhering to principles of fairness and accountability when interpreting results.\nOne key area I focus on is the potential for misrepresentation or misuse of data. Students learn to critically evaluate the quality and source of their data, considering questions such as: Who collected this data? What assumptions underlie its collection? What potential biases might influence its interpretation? This reflective approach ensures that students develop a conscientious mindset towards the power and responsibility that come with handling data.\nAnother significant aspect is teaching students about privacy and confidentiality. With growing concerns over data breaches and misuse, students explore frameworks for ensuring that personal or sensitive information is safeguarded during analysis. Through case studies and discussions, I highlight real-world examples of ethical dilemmas and encourage students to propose solutions grounded in established ethical guidelines.\nAs Scheaffer (1998) emphasized, statistical education must include the awareness of the societal impact of statistical methods. This means teaching students not only to be proficient analysts but also to act as ethical stewards of the data they handle.\nFinally, I incorporate discussions on the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making, especially in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Students are introduced to the concepts of algorithmic fairness and the risks of perpetuating biases through automated systems. By understanding these challenges, students are better prepared to contribute to a field that increasingly influences societal decisions.\n\n\n\nAssessment as a Tool for Learning\nAssessments in my courses follow Black and Wiliam (1998) formative assessment framework, designed not only to evaluate student performance but also to enhance learning through continuous feedback loops (Hubbard 1997). By integrating coding as an essential component, I aim to bridge theoretical mathematics with algorithmic thinking, creating what Black and Wiliam (1998) term “moment of learning” where assessment directly informs instruction. Students demonstrate their understanding of econometric and statistical concepts while implementing these concepts programmatically using tools like Python and R (see Section 5).\nFor example, I incorporate exercises that use R or Python to solve mathematical problems, optimize functions, and model complex systems (Sierra 2020; Ihantola et al. 2015). This approach helps students transition from abstract mathematical reasoning to tangible, applied problem-solving skills, with automated feedback systems providing immediate guidance on their progress. Additionally, version control tools such as Git and platforms like GitHub are integral to my courses (Beckman et al. 2021). Students learn to manage their code repositories, collaborate on projects, and integrate their work with our Learning Management System (LMS), Canvas, creating what Black and Wiliam (1998) describe as a “formative assessment practice.”\nThe use of SaaS platforms, like WISEflow, further enhances the assessment process by enabling what Ihantola et al. (2015) term “continuous process improvement in a learning context.” Practical exams conducted on this platform allow me to test students’ applied skills in econometrics and data analysis (Pfannkuch and Wild (2000)). Beyond grading, WISEflow enables me to provide detailed feedback reports to students, implementing Black and Wiliam (1998) principles of effective feedback by highlighting specific strengths and areas for improvement. This iterative feedback mechanism helps students refine their skills and deepen their understanding of the material.\nThe figure below demonstrates the effectiveness of this assessment approach, showing the aggregate percentile for grades C and B in SOK-3020 Econometrics for business students. These students do not have the same mathematical background as economics program students, hence it is considered a difficult topic. The positive trend in aggregate grades after 2017 aligns with Ihantola et al. (2015)’s findings on the benefits of integrated programming assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy integrating coding, algorithmic thinking, and modern technological tools into assessments, I ensure that students gain a comprehensive, practical, and forward-looking education (Combs et al. 2008). I also use these tools to automatically generate individual feedback on student performance (see Section 6), implementing what Black and Wiliam (1998) describe as “assessment for learning” rather than merely assessment of learning. These strategies not only measure student performance but also foster a continuous learning process that equips them with the skills to excel in academia and industry."

    "section": "Plans Ahead",
    "text": "Plans Ahead\nLooking forward, the master program in Economics with Data Science is incorporating cutting-edge machine learning techniques that extend beyond the traditional methodological toolbox typically available to economists (Varian 2014). These advancements are essential as we aim to equip students with the skills required to analyze complex and unstructured data, including text, which has become increasingly relevant in both research and industry (Bickley, Chan, and Torgler 2022).\nMy own research now includes using text as data (Gentzkow, Kelly, and Taddy 2019), leveraging advancements such as Large Language Models (LLMs). These tools have transformed how we analyze and interpret textual information, making them a necessary component of our teaching. By integrating LLMs into the curriculum, we provide students with the opportunity to work with text data in ways that were previously unattainable. For instance, students learn how to preprocess, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from text, ensuring they are well-prepared to navigate a data-rich, text-driven world.\nIn addition to teaching text analysis, we are also exploring how LLMs can support students in solving coding tasks. These tools have the potential to reduce the barriers students often face when learning to program, offering real-time assistance in debugging and refining their code. As part of this initiative, we are investigating ways to seamlessly incorporate LLMs into the teaching environment, ensuring they are used effectively as educational aids rather than shortcuts.\nBeyond the Economics with Data Science programs, coding skills are now being integrated into other programs at the Business School. This expansion reflects a broader shift toward embedding computational literacy across disciplines. I am committed to contributing to this development, ensuring that all students have access to the tools and training necessary for data-driven decision-making.\nFurthermore, many researchers and students at the Business School currently focus on traditional qualitative analysis. As the use of text analytics becomes more prevalent, there will be a growing need to support these individuals in transitioning to approaches that treat text as data suitable for computational analysis. By providing targeted training and resources, we can help staff and students adopt these methodologies, enriching their research capabilities and preparing them for the future of qualitative and mixed-methods research.\nThese plans represent a commitment to staying at the forefront of educational and technological innovation, ensuring that our students and staff are well-equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly evolving academic and professional landscape."
